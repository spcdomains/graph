            The community features, including forums and user reviews, are also
            a huge plus. Steam's regular updates and the addition of features
            like Steam Workshop and Steam Cloud enhance the gaming experience

            The store's clean interface and frequent discounts are attractive to
            gamers. The exclusivity of some high-profile games and the weekly
            free games keep users engaged.

            The user interface is straightforward, and the store often offers
            great deals on both new and old games. GOG also provides a seamless
            experience with its Galaxy client.

            The platform's interface is functional but can be clunky, and its
            library is limited to Ubisoft titles. The need to have yet another
            launcher for your games can be a drawback for some users.
